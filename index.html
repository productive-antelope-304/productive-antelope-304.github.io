        While I mainly focus on software development, I have from time to time
        endeavored to design such software. During my time at Brown University,
        I took a course in designing User Interfaces and User Experiences for
        digital computer systems.

          I was tasked with making a React-based web app and decided to embrace

        For this assignment, I identified usability, learnability, memorability,
        and accessibility problems with the existing website; then used those
        findings to develop a refined approach. I also designed a basic
        Bootstrap-style UI component framework from scratch, featuring text
        fields, several styles of button, and dropdowns.

        Since this assignment was largely focussed on using React to make a web
        app, I decided to have a little fun with the UI portion. I used an off
        the shelf library for the Windows 95/98 theming, but incorporated the
        elements into a unique UI based around windows. I also carefully
        adjusted spacing to ensure that things looked good. Finally, I used
        Stable Diffusion and ImageMagick to create the exact aesthetic I wanted
        for the city photos. (None of the photos are real)

        For this assignment, I worked with a team to identify a
        recently-launched startup, and then created a mockup for a mobile app
        based on the description of their company. We went through multiple
        stages of design, including brainstorming a variety of sketches,
        consolidating them into a single low-fi wireframe, converting that to a
        high-fidelity Figma mockup, and then making design adjustments after
        talking to a professional designer and our peers.

        I worked with a team to design and build a tool for creating and

        developed tools to enable the checklists to change over time while still
        retaining the ability to audit previous sessions with the checklist.
