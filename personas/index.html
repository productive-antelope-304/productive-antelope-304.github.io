<h1><strong style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: 900; font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;">CSCI1300</strong><br>Personas &amp; Storyboarding</h1>
<article>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: we were asked to identify an interface in public view, interrogate a few people who used it, and develop personas and a storyboard to better understand the interface.</p>

<h2>Part 1: Preparation</h2>

<p>Pikachu, I choose <strong>the Coke Freestyle machines at the ratty</strong>! I <em>definitely</em> didn’t encounter anyone else who picked the same interface as me!</p>

<p>Hi there, it seems like you’re about to quench your thirst. How about you grab a drink, and then answer me these questions five?</p>

<ol>
	<li>When you walked up to this machine, did you have a drink in mind?</li>
	<li>How easy was it to explore the available drink options? What difficulties did you experience?</li>
	<li>How often do you use the machine?</li>
	<li>How would you characterize the difference between similar flavors of different brands of soda (for example, Orange Fanta vs Orange Sprite)?</li>
	<li>Do the occasional promotions of flavors Bring You Value™?</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some simplified “screenshots” of the particular Coke Freestyle machines we have, for the uninitiated:</p>

<h2>Part 2: Recording Observations</h2>

<h3>Observations</h3>

<ul>
	<li>sessions were very short, with a maximum of a couple seconds on the machine.</li>
	<li>some of them knew what they wanted and the steps to get the machine to dispense </li>
	<li>others spent some time exploring the options</li>
</ul>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ol>
	<li>When you walked up to this machine, did you have a drink in mind?

		<ul>
			<li>some did, some didn’t.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>How easy was it to explore the available drink options? What difficulties did you experience?

		<ul>
			<li>folks seemed to feel like the interface was easy to use, but were confused that not all drinks (e.g. juices) were available from the machine, and that they had to go elsewhere to a machine with a different interaction model to get those drinks</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>How often do you use the machine?

		<ul>
			<li>some used it every day, others rarely used it</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>How would you characterize the difference between similar flavors of different brands?

		<ul>
			<li>nobody knew how to answer this question</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Do the occasional promotions of flavors Bring You Value™?

		<ul>
			<li>most people answered no, but one said they thought it was cool.</li>
		</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Part 3: Personas</h2>

<h3>Thirsty Theo</h3>

<p><strong>THINKS</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I just want water, the juice of life!</li>
	<li>Soda is too sweet</li>
	<li>The other water machines are too slow</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FEELS</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Thirsty</li>
	<li>Hurried</li>
	<li>Mildly annoyed if he had to wait in line</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SAYS</strong>: (nothing, he just wants to be done)</p>

<p><strong>DOES</strong>: taps “water,” fills his cup</p>

<p>Theo is a college student who just wants his glass of water so he can enjoy dinner with his friends without dying of dehydration. He wants quick access to the “water” option and rarely explores the interface beyond that.</p>

<p>One problem Theo faces is that while water is 1 tap away on the home screen, he often has to navigate back from one of the other beverage screens. But this isn’t really an issue. He’s mainly annoyed by people like Claire who take too long to pick a drink, forcing him to wait.</p>

<p>Theo represents the people who just some nice cold water while at the ratty.</p>

<h3>Curious Claire</h3>

<p><strong>THINKS</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I wonder what I’ll drink tonight?</li>
	<li>do I want caffeine at this time of day?</li>
	<li>ooh cherry fanta, haven’t had that one before!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FEELS</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Thirsty</li>
	<li>Aware of the people waiting behind her in line</li>
	<li>Curious about the sickly-sweet flavors available to her</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SAYS</strong>: (generally nothing, this is not a social activity)</p>

<p><strong>DOES</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>taps around for a bit to see the options</li>
	<li>selects a soda option</li>
	<li>dispenses into cup, either with or without ice</li>
</ul>

<p>Claire is also a college student, but she likes variety in her drinks. Mindful of the line behind her (if any), she likes to take a couple of seconds to glance at the available options, although a year or more of time spent using this drink machine resulted in a pretty much photographic memory of what the different drinks are. She wants to be able to quickly tap through the available drinks to see what sparks joy tonight.</p>

<p>One problem Claire faces is that the interface is somewhat unpleasant to use. The touchscreen does not immediately respond to taps, and the attempts at animation make the experience feel more janky and serve only to slow things down further. She also wishes there better ways to filter the drinks based on the ~vibes~ of the night (but also hasn’t used the existing filter options).</p>
